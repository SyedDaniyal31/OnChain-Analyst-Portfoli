# Case Studies & Research

### Cryptocurrency Market: Overheating Hasn't Even Started
**Date:** July 2025  
**Tools Used:** CryptoQuant    
**Objective:** Identify whether Bitcoin is entering an overheated market phase by analyzing realized cap – UTXO age bands.

**Process:**
- Examined UTXO age band data from CryptoQuant, focusing on coins moved within 1 day to 1 week.  
- Compared current activity with past overheating phases (March 2024 and December 2024).  
- Highlighted age-band spikes and correlated them with Bitcoin’s price action.  

**Key Insights:**
- In March 2024 and December 2024, sharp spikes in short-term UTXO activity aligned with market overheating and local price tops.  
- As of July 2025, current age-band activity remains relatively low compared to those peaks.  
- This indicates the market has **not yet entered an overheated state**, leaving potential room for further upside.

**Date:** August 2025  
**Tools Used:** CryptoQuant  
**Objective:** Identify signals of a new bullish ETH cycle relative to Bitcoin.

**Process:**
- Tracked the ETH/BTC price ratio against its **365-day moving average**.  
- Compared current breakout with past cycles where ETH outperformed BTC.  
- Monitored ETF flows, focusing on the ETH/BTC ETF holdings ratio to measure institutional allocation trends.  

**Key Insights:**
- The ETH/BTC ratio has **crossed above its 365-day SMA**, a level that historically marks the start of bullish ETH cycles.  
- ETF investors are **increasing ETH allocations relative to BTC**, as seen in the rising ETH/BTC ETF holdings ratio.  
- Renewed demand from both **institutions and traders** suggests ETH could enter a period of **sustained outperformance** versus Bitcoin.  
- Historically, such crossovers have preceded multi-month ETH rallies, particularly during periods of strong narrative momentum (DeFi, staking, or ETF approvals).

### ETFs and MSTR Accumulation vs. Bitcoin Price Action
**Date:** July 2025  
**Tools Used:** CryptoQuant  
**Objective:** Analyze Bitcoin accumulation by ETFs and MicroStrategy (MSTR) to evaluate why large institutional buying hasn’t led to new all-time highs.

**Process:**
- Examined CryptoQuant data tracking ETF and MSTR Bitcoin purchases leading up to July 2025.  
- Compared current accumulation trends with historical demand peaks in December 2024.  
- Analyzed 30-day inflow/outflow trends to assess net demand impact on Bitcoin’s price.  

**Key Insights:**
- **Institutional Accumulation:**  
  - ETFs accumulated **377K BTC** and MSTR acquired **371K BTC** before July 2025.  
  - At the peak of demand growth (Dec 7, 2024), ETFs and MSTR accounted for **33% of total demand growth (771K BTC)**.  
- **Weakening Broader Demand:**  
  - Net Bitcoin demand contracted by **895K BTC in the last 30 days**, offsetting positive impacts from ETF/MSTR purchases.  
  - This explains why price momentum has stalled despite institutional headlines.  
- **Declining Purchase Rates:**  
  - ETF monthly purchases dropped from **86K BTC (Dec 2024)** → **71K BTC (May 2025)** → **40K BTC (July 2025)** (a **53% decline**).  
  - MSTR’s monthly purchases declined from **171K BTC (Dec 2024)** → **16K BTC (July 2025)** (a **90% decline**).  
- **Conclusion:**  
  - Institutional buying remains a net positive, but insufficient to fuel a breakout.  
  - Without broader spot demand growth, Bitcoin is likely to remain in **consolidation** rather than surging to new ATHs.

### Bitcoin Long-Term Holders: 30% Supply Untouched for Over 5 Years
**Date:** June 2025  
**Tools Used:** Glassnode (HODL Waves, UTXO Age Bands)  
**Objective:** Analyze Bitcoin’s long-term holder dynamics and estimate the percentage of coins permanently lost.  

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd46a48-9de6-475b-89ac-e1ddfe737ecd)

**Process:**
- Examined Bitcoin HODL waves and UTXO age distribution from Glassnode.  
- Focused on coins untouched for **5+ years**, representing long-term conviction or lost wallets.  
- Estimated the percentage of coins likely lost forever based on inactivity trends.  

**Key Insights:**
- **30% of Bitcoin supply** has remained unmoved for over 5 years, reflecting strong long-term holder conviction.  
- An estimated **7.5% of BTC supply** is likely lost forever due to forgotten keys, lost hardware wallets, or early-era mishandling.  
- This effectively reduces Bitcoin’s **liquid circulating supply**, strengthening the scarcity narrative.  
- Historical data suggests that increases in the share of long-term holders often precede major bull market phases.
